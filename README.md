# Class Schedule API

This project provides an API for managing a class schedule at a university level. It's built with Java and uses Spring Boot for the backend. The scheduling algorithm uses iterative forward search with backtracking.

## Features

- Scheduling for all programs and all years in a program. If it's a 4-year program, 4 timetables are generated from 1st year up to 4th year.
- Scheduling is done for courses only for the specified semester.
- Able to schedule inter-faculty courses without collision.
- Ensures a lecturer is not given two courses to teach at the same time.
- Ensures a student does not have a common course and faculty course scheduled at the same time. Common courses start with a course code of 'CCS'.
- Checks room availability and department relevance before scheduling.
- View schedules by instructor.
- View schedules for a specific program, year, and semester.
- Each schedule includes the course code, instructor name, room name, and time slot.

## Hard Constraints

- Room availability.
- Instructor availability.

## Soft Constraints

- Preferred time slot.

## Optimization Ideas

- Use a heuristic to choose the most promising course to schedule next, rather than always going in order.
- Try to schedule the most difficult courses first (those with the fewest available rooms or time slots).
- Implement some form of local search or constraint propagation to prune the search space.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java 11+
- Maven
- MySQL

### Installation

1. Clone the repo:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/kyalo-vibes/university-timetabling
    ```

2. Build the project:
    ```
